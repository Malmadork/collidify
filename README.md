# collidify
collidify is a jQuery plugin that handles jQuery UI draggable collision events, such as revert, collide, and border.

# Introduction
During the process of working one of my projects, I really wanted to have draggable elements around a countainer, but revert back if invalid. Some libraries worked decently, but still overflowed outside of containers, or weren't very intuitive. I sought to solve this issue and make collision and revert events easier in jQuery. 

> This plugin is a work in progress, and am adding more features and accessibility optiions.

# Documentation
